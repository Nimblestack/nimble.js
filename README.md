# nimble.js
With the Nimble.js library, user login, registration, and API connectivity are deployed instantly using a single JavaScript file. Nimble.js is a simple HTTP client to automatically authenticate and connect to the [developer portal](https://portal.nimblescript.io). It is designed to work from either a web application or a Cordova hybrid mobile application. Nimble.js is dependent upon two popular frameworks, [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), it is extensible and can be used with many JavaScript / CSS frameworks.

Our [developer portal](https://portal.nimblescript.io) is a set of online forms. These forms allow integration of multiple API requests, in sequence or in parallel. These requests are converted into a single JSON/XML endpoint. You can use these API endpoints in your applications and products. These endpoints can be expressed as either private or public APIs.

Nimble.js provides a simple yet powerful JavaScript SDK for connecting and communicating with our [developer portal](https://portal.nimblescript.io). The core functionality of an application built with Datadipity[LINK] is small enough to fit into a single JavaScript file and a single HTML file that work together.

The JavaScript SDK is the core target for [Nimblestack](https://nimblestack.io) development. Our process has been tested at more than 50 hackathons to develop a wide range of applications for a wide array of platforms. It is very easy for front-end developer to develop complex and fully integrated software products with simple tools such as HTML5 and JavaScript. When using JavaScript and our [developer portal](https://portal.nimblescript.io), software becomes highly scalable and very easy to maintain.

App Files
=========
In the "app" directory is a application boilerplate to get up and running quickly.

Debug
=====
In the "debug" folder is the raw Nimble.js as well as Jquery2 to include in your app. If you are extending the library or run into trouble, these files are not compressed making it easier to debug your software.
